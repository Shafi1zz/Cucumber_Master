//Testing to see if we can push to main branch
//So main branch and master branches are the same,
//Depends on which one is set as default,
//github might be getting rid of master branch because it's 
//related to slavery

// Back after a couple days on eclipse need to see if I can still 
//Push code back on
//What I have done
//learning cypress set it up
//need to connect git and github on it
